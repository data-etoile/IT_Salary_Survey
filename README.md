IT Salary Survey in Germany
Since 2015, an annual salary survey has been conducted among European IT specialists, with a particular emphasis on Germany. Due to the majority of respondents being from Germany (90%), we will focus this survey exclusively on the German IT community.

Please note that a significant number of respondents in this salary survey are expatriates. As a result, it's important to be mindful of potential biases that may arise due to this fact.

The primary objective of this survey is to gain insights into the competitive value of various skillsets among IT specialists, considering factors such as years of experience, position, language proficiency, and more. Here you will find a detailed comparative analysis of the aggregated and anonymized responses from voluntary participants in Germany.
 
I analyzed data in Jupyter Notebook and created visualizations using the Plotly library. However, GitHub provides does not display the interactive Plotly graphs, as they require embedded HTML/JavaScript.

To view the interactive visualizations, please follow these steps:      
      
Copy and pase the link of my GitHub notebook that you want to view here https://nbviewer.org/

This will redirect you to the nbviewer platform, which will render the notebook with all the interactive Plotly graphs visible.

Feel free to explore the visualizations and the rest of the notebook. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask!
